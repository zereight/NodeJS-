To run this Sandbox, you will have to add your username in the line 10 of models/Movie.js
We are all sharing a database, adding your username is required so we can all work on the same DB at the same time.
To find your username, go to challenges.nomadcoders.co and look for your username, i.e @serranoarevalo

The routes you have to make are:

/ <-- See all movies
/create <-- Create a movie (html form)
/:id <-- See movie by ID
/:id/edit <-- Edit movie by ID
/:id/delete <-- Delete movie by ID
/search <-- Search movies

조건:

Using Mongoose, create a CRUD (Create, Read, Delete, Update) Application for Movies.
Make all the six routes with their controllers.
On the line 12 of models/Movie.js you have to create a complete schema for your movie model. The schema should have the fields id, title, year, rating, synopsis, genres[], uploadedAt
All the fields are required.
You need to validate that the year is a number.
You need to validate that the title is at least 3 characters long.
When I create a movie I should be redirected to the detail page of that movie.
When a movie is not found I should see a 404.
When I delete a movie I should be redirected to the home page.
On the /search page I should be able to filter by greater than or equal ( $gte ) /search?year=1900 or /search?rating=9.6
The app must behave exactly like the video
